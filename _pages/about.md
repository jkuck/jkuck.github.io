Fun
------
I like sports.  I enjoy the [outdoors](https://jkuck.github.io/halfdome_img.html), rock climbing, tennis, and [rolling on balance balls](https://github.com/jkuck/jkuck.github.io/blob/master/images/ball_rolling.MOV).  I used to focus on [speedskating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vojCzsek38).
